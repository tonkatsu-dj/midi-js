# midi-js
this is my attempt at using code to control midi for logic pro's built-in compiler. in simpler terms, i'm writing music with a super long javascript array. ship-1 is the initial test, just making sure it's even feasible. further ships will dive a little deeper into sound design and generative music.
## how to use
1. convert a midi file into an array using midi-to-array.js
2. insert your array into scripter-file.js
3. run scripter-file.js within a new logic channel strip
